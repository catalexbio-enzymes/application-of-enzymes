# Brewery & Distillery Enzymes — Starch Conversion, Fermentation & Quality

Enzymes are essential tools in brewery and distillery processes, especially for
converting starches into fermentable sugars, improving mash efficiency, and
enhancing overall process performance. Enzyme systems such as glucoamylase,
fungal and bacterial amylases, proteases, and β‑glucanases help break down
complex substrates in cereals and adjuncts, enabling consistent fermentation
and optimized product quality.

Below are technical guides covering key enzyme applications in brewery and
distillery operations:

## 1. Glucoamylase vs Fungal vs Bacterial Amylase — Starch‑to‑Sugar Conversion  
This article provides a comparative technical overview of different amylase
types used in starch conversion. It discusses how glucoamylase, fungal amylase,
and bacterial amylase differ in mode of action, temperature/pH optima,
substrate specificity, and suitability for high‑gravity brewing and distillery
mashes.
