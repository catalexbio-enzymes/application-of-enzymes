# Catalex Bio – Tehnical guide and applicatons of Industrial Enzymes

This page provides introductory technical notes on the role of enzymes in
detergents, food processing, beverages, distilling, bakery, dairy, nutraceutical
and plant-extract applications. Enzymes such as amylase, protease, lipase,
cellulase, mannanase, pectinase, xylanase, maltogenic amylase, glucose oxidase,
bromelain and papain contribute to hydrolysis, clarification, viscosity control,
fermentation efficiency, and improved product functionality across various
industrial processes.

These notes are intended for engineers, formulators and process specialists who
seek neutral, scientific reference material on enzymatic applications in
manufacturing environments.
