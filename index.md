# Catalex Bio – Technical Guide and Applications of Industrial Enzymes

This page provides introductory technical notes on the role of enzymes in
detergents, food processing, beverages, distilling, bakery, dairy,
nutraceutical and plant-extract applications. Enzymes such as amylase, protease,
lipase, cellulase, mannanase, pectinase, xylanase, maltogenic amylase, glucose
oxidase, bromelain and papain contribute to hydrolysis, clarification, viscosity
control, fermentation efficiency, and improved product functionality across 
various industrial processes.

These notes are intended for engineers, formulators and process specialists who
seek neutral, scientific reference material on enzymatic applications in
manufacturing environments.
