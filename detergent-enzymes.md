# Detergent Enzymes – Technical Overview

Enzymes such as protease, amylase, lipase, cellulase and mannanase are core 
components in modern detergent formulations, improving stain removal, cold-wash 
performance, fabric care and overall wash efficiency. These enzymes act on 
proteins, starches, fats and polysaccharides that surfactants alone cannot 
effectively remove, enabling better cleaning with lower chemical load and 
reduced energy consumption.

Below are technical summaries of key detergent enzyme topics relevant to 
industrial detergent manufacturers and formulators:
