# General Enzymes Overview

Enzymes are biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions and are used
extensively in industrial processing for efficiency, specificity, and sustainability.
This overview introduces key concepts and several important industrial enzymes
commonly applied across detergent, food, brewing, bakery, feed, juice, starch
processing and plant-derived applications.

Below are links to detailed technical guides covering enzyme basics, production
sources, individual enzyme mechanisms, and comparative insights:
