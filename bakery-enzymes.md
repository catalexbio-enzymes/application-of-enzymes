# Bakery Enzymes — Technical Overview

Industrial bakery processes rely on specialized enzymes to improve dough handling,
crumb structure, shelf life, and overall product quality. Enzymes such as
maltogenic amylase, xylanase, and other functional enzymes modify starch,
gluten and other components to optimize baking performance in commercial
production lines.

Below are technical summaries of key bakery enzyme topics from our blog:

---

## 1. Maltogenic Amylase in Bread Production

## 7. Enzymes for Chapati & Roti Softness
This article focuses on flatbread applications such as chapati and roti, explaining how enzymes like maltogenic amylase, α-amylase, xylanase, and mild protease are used to improve softness, puffing, rollability, and delayed staling. It also discusses why controlling texture at the flour-mill or formulation stage delivers more consistent results than relying on end-user preparation.

## 7. Enzymes for Chapati & Roti Softness  
This article focuses on flatbread applications such as chapati and roti,
explaining how enzymes like maltogenic amylase, α-amylase, xylanase, glucose
oxidase, and mild protease are used to improve softness, puffing, rollability,
and delayed staling. It also discusses why controlling texture at the flour-mill
or formulation stage delivers more consistent results than relying on end-user
preparation.
