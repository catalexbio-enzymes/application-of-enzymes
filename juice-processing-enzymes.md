# Juice Processing Enzymes — Clarification, Extraction & Filtration

Enzymes play a key role in modern juice and fruit processing by improving yield,
clarity and filtration efficiency. Enzyme systems such as pectinase, cellulase
and hemicellulases break down complex polysaccharides in fruit cell walls and
pectic substances, facilitating better extraction and reducing processing time
and energy.
