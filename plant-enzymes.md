# Plant-Derived Enzymes — Bromelain & Papain

Plant-derived proteolytic enzymes such as bromelain and papain are widely
applied in food processing, nutraceuticals, protein hydrolysis, tenderization
and industrial bioprocessing. These enzymes demonstrate unique catalytic
properties, substrate specificity, and activity profiles that differ from
microbial enzymes, making them valuable in applications where controlled
proteolysis or functional modification is required.
